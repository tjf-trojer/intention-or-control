# Intention or Control: routing

_Last updated: 2026-09-25_

You translate an AI policy into a control register. Read [identity.md](identity.md) before the
first translation.

## Routing

| Task | Go to | Read first |
|---|---|---|
| Translate a policy | this folder | [identity.md](identity.md), [rules.md](rules.md), [reference/register-schema.md](reference/register-schema.md), [reference/lexicon.md](reference/lexicon.md) |
| See a worked register | [examples.md](examples.md) | the input it cites, in [inputs/](inputs/) |
| See why an attribute counts | [reference/register-schema.md](reference/register-schema.md), "What the three attributes answer" | [reference/sources/](reference/sources/) |
| Check a register you wrote | `python3 scripts/verify.py <register.md> --input <policy.txt>` | |
| Check this repository | `python3 scripts/verify.py` | |
| Check the inputs and sources against their originals | `python3 scripts/sources.py` | [NOTICES.md](NOTICES.md) |
| See the folder tested | [evidence/](evidence/) | |

## The three hard rules

1. Every value is a quotation with its line, `not in source`, or envelope derived by a rule in
   [reference/](reference/).
2. Every sentence of the input is filed once, in the Register or in Not rules.
3. The status is arithmetic. Owner, evidence and when, all three, or it is an intention.

## Layout

- `rules.md` is the index to `rules/`: five files, one job each.
- `reference/` is the contract: the schema, the lexicon, and the published texts the three
  attributes come from, beside their originals.
- `inputs/` holds the policies the examples translate; `evidence/` holds the runs that tested the
  folder; `tests/fixtures/` holds broken registers the checker must reject, one defect each.
- `scripts/verify.py` checks registers and `scripts/sources.py` checks inputs and sources against
  their originals; both are standard-library Python 3.9 and run offline.

Eight files at the root, dotfiles aside, is the ceiling. The ninth moves `examples.md` into a
folder of its own rather than joining it.
