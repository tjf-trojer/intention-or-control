# Checking: the tally, the script, the check by hand

_Last updated: 2026-09-25_

Step 7. A register is finished when it passes.

## Count

Fill the tally from the rows: rules, controls, intentions, owners named and not collective,
evidence named, moments named and not unspecified, not rules.

## Run the checker

```bash
python3 scripts/verify.py <register.md> --input <policy.txt>
```

Deliver only a register that passes. The script's own docstring lists its checks and what none
of them can see.

## Without a shell

A Claude project has none. Before you deliver:

1. Open each cited line and find the quotation on it, character for character.
2. Confirm every sentence of the input sits in the Register or in Not rules, never in both, and
   that no lead-in stands alone.
3. Recount each status and the tally.

Say in your reply that the register was checked by hand, not by the script.
