# Worked registers

_Last updated: 2026-09-24_

Real policies, translated. Each register cites its input in [`inputs/`](inputs/) by line, and
`python3 scripts/verify.py` checks every register on this page against its input in its default
run. Sources and licences are in [`NOTICES.md`](NOTICES.md).

# Example 1: UK guidance to civil servants on generative AI (2023, since superseded)

Guidance written almost entirely as advice. The summary's «Never put sensitive information or
personal data into these tools.» (L11) is a rule; the body's «You should never put sensitive
information or personal data into these tools.» (L43) is a recommendation. The register files each
where its own words put it and says nothing about the difference. Every owner it finds is the
collective «users», from L23, and the register keeps the flag.

# Example 2: Wikipedia bot policy (English Wikipedia, revision 1371001773)

A community's rules for automated agents. «Should the operator return» (L31) is a condition, so
its sentence is filed by its «must». The passive rules at L31 («will be deauthorized», «will be
removed») name no one who acts, and the register does not supply the bureaucrat a reader would expect.
The one control is R7: an office, a record and a trigger, all in one sentence.

# Example 3: OMB Memorandum M-25-21, section 3 (April 3, 2025)

A government mandate, read from an OCR'd PDF. The issuer stays «OFFlCEOFMANAGEMENTANDBUDGET» and the
budget office stays «0MB»: the register keeps what the page prints. Owners here are named offices
(«CAI Os», «Agency heads»), and three rules carry a record and a moment as well: the compliance
plans (R36), the policy update (R40) and the use-case inventory (R43). Where a lead-in says
«Agency heads must:» and the item's own sentence says «each agency must», the lead-in supplies the
owner. A fresh session produced this register from the folder alone; `evidence/cold-run.md` lists
the owner cells corrected afterwards and why.
