# Lexicon: the word lists a register applies

_Last updated: 2026-09-24_

Three lists. The translator applies them as written and `scripts/verify.py` reads them from this
file. A list that is wrong for one policy is wrong for all of them, and it changes here.

A term matches as whole words, in any case. The longest term wins: `must not` before `must`,
`should never` before `should`, `is not permitted` before `permitted`.

**Strength**, strongest first: MUST NOT and MUST, with their imperative forms; WILL NOT and WILL;
SHOULD NOT and SHOULD; MAY. A sentence's force is its strongest term, and the strongest term
decides where it is filed.

**Forced.** `yes`: a sentence holding the term is a rule, wherever the term stands. `opening`: a
sentence the term opens, after any list marker, is a rule. Where the term opens a main clause
(«…social media sites, do not input…») it is a force term the translator reads. Anywhere else it is
an ordinary word: «so long as they do not conflict» holds no force term. `no`: the translator reads
the sentence. A descriptive "will" ("These tools will answer your question") and a conditional
"should" ("Should the operator return") are statements. A question is never forced.

**Imperatives.** An instruction whose sentence or main clause opens with a bare verb is a rule of
class MUST (imperative); `never`, `do not` and `don't` make it MUST NOT (imperative). The Force cell
quotes the lexicon term where there is one («Never», «Always», «do not»), and otherwise the opening
verb or verb phrase («be aware», «consider»). An imperative stands at an opening: the start of a
sentence, after a list marker, or after a comma, semicolon or colon, with at most a joining «and»,
«but», «or» or «then» between. «Agencies are encouraged to update» holds no imperative. A verb that
only points the reader somewhere ("Note that", "See") or asks a favour ("please contact") is not
an instruction, and its sentence is a statement.

## Collective owners

An Owner quotation is flagged `(collective)` when its head is a crowd. Lowercase the quotation and
cut it before the first cut word below, and before a word ending in `-ing` that directly follows a
crowd word. The flag is set when what remains equals a crowd entry or ends with one. «users» and
«All users directing a bot» are crowds; «the head of each agency» («the head») and «Agency heads»
are not.

| Cut word |
|---|
| of |
| for |
| in |
| on |
| at |
| to |
| with |
| who |
| whom |
| whose |
| that |
| which |

| Collective |
|---|
| we |
| us |
| you |
| everyone |
| everybody |
| anyone |
| staff |
| employees |
| users |
| colleagues |
| personnel |
| workforce |
| civil servants |
| contributors |
| editors |
| members |
| agency |
| agencies |
| organisation |
| organization |
| organisations |
| organizations |
| company |
| community |
| government |
| leaders |
| officials |

A collective owner names who is meant and no one in particular who answers. The register keeps the
quotation and flags it.

## Timing words

A When quotation is flagged `(unspecified)` unless it holds at least one of these:

| Kind | Words |
|---|---|
| Digit | a number written in digits, not joined to letters: «30», «2036»; not the «0» of «0MB» |
| Number | one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, ninety, hundred |
| Frequency | annually, annual, yearly, monthly, weekly, daily, quarterly, every |
| Trigger | before, after, upon, prior, following, within, until, whenever |

"Regularly", "periodically", "on an ongoing basis" and "as needed" fix no moment anyone could
check, so they carry the flag.
