# The register: the output contract

_Last updated: 2026-09-24_

Every translation is one register with five sections, in this order, whatever the policy looks
like. `scripts/verify.py` fails a register that breaks anything on this page.

| # | Heading | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `## Source` | What the policy says about itself |
| 2 | `## Register` | One row per rule: force, addressee, owner, evidence, timing, status |
| 3 | `## Not rules` | Every other sentence of the input, filed |
| 4 | `## Referred elsewhere` | Documents the policy names and the register did not receive |
| 5 | `## Tally` | Counts derived from sections 2 and 3 |

Every sentence of the input sits in section 2 or in section 3, never in both. Title lines, headings
and the omission mark `[...]` sit in section 3, even when section 1 quotes them too.

## Quotations

- A quotation is the input's text between `«` and `»`, a space, and the line it sits on:
  `«Bots must edit only while logged into their account.» L19`. A span over lines is `L12-L14`.
  Line numbers count every line of the input from 1, blank lines included. A span starts on the
  line where the quotation starts and ends on the line where it ends.
- The text is the input's, character for character: its spelling, capitals, typing and OCR errors.
  Two differences are tolerated. A run of whitespace, including a line break inside a span, counts
  as one space. Typographic quotes and apostrophes match their straight forms.
- Several quotations in one cell are joined by ` + `. A `|` inside a quotation is written `\|`.
- A field the input does not fill is `not in source`, in lower case, and nothing else.

Everything else in a register is envelope, derived by a rule on this page or in
[`lexicon.md`](lexicon.md): IDs, force classes, the two flags, statuses, filings, counts, and the
input's path. The envelope never states a fact about the policy that a quotation does not carry.

## 1. Source

```
| Field | Entry |
|---|---|
| Title | quotation, or not in source |
| Issued by | quotation, or not in source |
| Date or version | quotation(s) of a date, version or document number, or not in source |
| Input | the input's path from the repository root in backticks, or `pasted` |
```

## 2. Register

```
| ID | Rule | Force | Addressee | Owner | Evidence | When | Status |
```

| Column | Entry | What it holds |
|---|---|---|
| ID | `R1`, `R2`, and on | Rows run in the order of the line where each rule's own text ends: a list item's line, not its lead-in's |
| Rule | quotation(s) | A sentence whose strongest force term files it in the Register ([`lexicon.md`](lexicon.md)). A list item is quoted with its lead-in: `«CAI Os, in coordination with appropriate agency officials, must:» L26 + «J. support agency efforts to track AI spending.» L56` |
| Force | `«term» CLASS` | The strongest force term in the rule as printed, and its class from the lexicon. For an imperative outside the lexicon, its opening verb phrase |
| Addressee | quotation(s), or `not in source` | Whom the rule binds, as the rule's own quotations name them. An imperative names no one |
| Owner | quotation(s) with `(collective)` where the lexicon says so, or `not in source` | The role, person or body the text makes answerable for the rule being met: named as responsible or accountable for it, as the one who approves, maintains, reviews, enforces or ensures it, or as a named office the rule is addressed to. It is the only attribute that may come from another sentence, one that assigns responsibility for the same conduct; the quotation then carries that sentence's line. A collective addressee is not an owner by being addressed |
| Evidence | quotation(s), or `not in source` | An artefact or record the rule's own quotations name that would show the rule was met: a register, inventory, list, log, plan, report, notice, approval, request, flag, page, publication |
| When | quotation(s) with `(unspecified)` where the lexicon says so, or `not in source` | A frequency, date, deadline or triggering event the rule's own quotations fix for meeting or reviewing it. A condition of application ("when using the tool") is not a When |
| Status | `control`, or `intention: ` and the missing attributes | `control` when Owner is filled and not collective, Evidence is filled, and When is filled and not unspecified. Otherwise `intention: ` followed by what is missing, in the order `owner, evidence, when` |

### What the three attributes answer

The status tests three attributes because published governance texts ask for the same three.

| Attribute | Provision | Its words |
|---|---|---|
| Owner | [NIST AI RMF, GOVERN 2.1](sources/nist-ai-rmf-govern.txt#L25) | «Roles and responsibilities and lines of communication related to mapping, measuring, and managing AI risks are documented and are clear to individuals and teams throughout the organization.» |
| Owner | [AI Act, Art. 17(1)(m)](sources/eu-ai-act-excerpts.txt#L25) | «an accountability framework setting out the responsibilities of the management and other staff» |
| Owner | [AI Act, Art. 26(2)](sources/eu-ai-act-excerpts.txt#L29) | «Deployers shall assign human oversight to natural persons» |
| Evidence | [AI Act, Art. 17(1)](sources/eu-ai-act-excerpts.txt#L12) | «documented in a systematic and orderly manner in the form of written policies, procedures and instructions» |
| Evidence | [AI Act, Art. 17(1)(k)](sources/eu-ai-act-excerpts.txt#L23) | «systems and procedures for record-keeping of all relevant documentation and information» |
| Evidence | [NIST AI RMF, section 5.1](sources/nist-ai-rmf-govern.txt#L12) | «Documentation can enhance transparency, improve human review processes, and bolster accountability in AI system teams.» |
| When | [NIST AI RMF, GOVERN 1.5](sources/nist-ai-rmf-govern.txt#L21) | «including determining the frequency of periodic review» |
| When | [AI Act, Art. 17(1)(d)](sources/eu-ai-act-excerpts.txt#L16) | «the frequency with which they have to be carried out» |
| When | [AI Act, Art. 9(2)](sources/eu-ai-act-excerpts.txt#L9) | «requiring regular systematic review and updating» |

ISO/IEC 42001, the certifiable standard for an AI management system, asks for the same three in
clause 5.3 (roles, responsibilities and authorities), clause 7.5 (documented information) and
clause 9 (performance evaluation). Its text is copyrighted and is not in this folder; the clause
numbers are pointers.

The provisions define the attributes. They do not say the policy under translation is bound by
them, and a register never says so either.

## 3. Not rules

```
| Text | Filed as |
```

| Filed as | When |
|---|---|
| `recommendation «term»` | The sentence recommends: its strongest binding force term has class SHOULD or SHOULD NOT |
| `optional «term»` | The sentence permits: its strongest binding force term has class MAY |
| `statement` | The sentence holds no force term, or holds one that does not bind here: a descriptive "will", a conditional "Should the operator return", a "may" of possibility |
| `heading` | A heading, a title line, or the omission mark `[...]` |

A sentence holding a forced term ([`lexicon.md`](lexicon.md)) is never filed here, unless it ends
in a question mark.

## 4. Referred elsewhere

```
| Reference |
```

One row per document the policy names by title or number, quoted as printed. With none, the
section holds the single line `No references in source.`

## 5. Tally

```
| Count | Value |
|---|---|
| Rules | n |
| Controls | n |
| Intentions | n |
| Owner named, not collective | n |
| Evidence named | n |
| When named, not unspecified | n |
| Not rules | n |
```

The rows, their names and their order are fixed. Every value is a count of rows in sections 2 and 3.
